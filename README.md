# UM6P-DATALAB-Competition 2023
A fun competition where we competed with other UM6P students to build a recommandation system.

## Goal

The DATALAB Store want to gain a competitive edge over their competitors and it needs your help. You will build a recommendation system using a dataset that includes customer ratings for products. To help the DATALAB Store and win this competition you will need to use data analysis and machine learning methods to develop a model that can predict customer ratings for specific products.
